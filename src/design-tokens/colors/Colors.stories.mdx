The following information and images are taken from this artice and quickly displayed for you.
You can also go to color generators for you such as [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) and [palletion.com](https://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF).

## Color Variables

Color variables are held within the colors.scss file. It has primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary, and quinary variables to add up to five colors. Dark and light variables are also there. Variables will need to be changed out for each project based on the color scheme. Themes are also available and can to be added to colors.scss following the example of dark theme. Start up React App to see theme change in action!

## Color Palettes

<br />
### Monochromatic

- Using various shades of one single color

  alt="monochromatic"
/>

### Analogous

- Formed by 3 colors next to each other on the wheel. Used when no contrast is needed.

  alt="analogous"
/>

### Complementary

- Two colors placed in front of eachother on the color wheel. They produce contrast.

## Common mistakes to avoid

<br />
### Too many colors

- Up to 3 primary colors
- 2 is already plenty

### Colored backgrounds

- Using colors in the backgrounds actually gets in the way
- The farthest you should go is gray background

### Pure black and white

- Using pure black and white make it hard to read. Please use offsets of black and white together

### 50 shades of gray

- Another common mistake is using way too many grays and you start to lack contrast

### Lack of contrast

- Do not use white on yellow background - it becomes inaccessible
- Accessible color contrasts can be checked at <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/" target="_blank">WebAim</a> or <a href="http://colorsafe.co/" target="_blank">ColorSafe</a>
