# Typography

Typography is about usability in a website. It is about emotion.

"95% of the information on the web is written language. It is only logical to say that a web designer should get good training in the main discipline of shaping written information, in other words: Typography."

## Fonts and typefaces

- Typefase is the design of a collection of glyphs
- Font is a specific size, weight, or style of typeface

Fonts are categorized by `serif` and `sans-serif`. Serif is a small stroke attached to end of letters for a traditional feel. Sans-serif does not have extra strokes for a smooth and modern feel.

Choosing a font should align with brand and content. Some designs use one typeface for headings and another for body text. Feel free to use <a href="https://www.fontpair.co/all" target="_blank">FontPair</a> to find a font pair that you like.
